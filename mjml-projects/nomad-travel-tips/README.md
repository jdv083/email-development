# MJML Email Template – First Project

This project is my first hands-on implementation using **MJML** to build a responsive HTML email template with a structured, component-based approach.

The goal of this project was to understand how MJML abstracts common email-development challenges while still producing reliable, email-client–friendly HTML.

---

## ✨ Features
- Built using MJML components (`mj-section`, `mj-column`, `mj-text`, `mj-button`)
- Responsive layout out of the box
- Mobile-first structure
- Clean, readable markup
- Easily maintainable and reusable sections

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me understand:
- How MJML simplifies responsive email layouts
- How MJML components compile into table-based HTML
- Proper use of padding and spacing within MJML
- Structuring emails in a modular, scalable way
- The difference between MJML source files and compiled HTML output

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- MJML
- HTML Email Best Practices
- VS Code
- Git / GitHub

---

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Build the email using MJML syntax (`index.mjml`)
2. Compile MJML into HTML using the MJML CLI or extension
3. Review compiled output for email-client compatibility
4. Iterate on layout and spacing

---

## 📌 Notes
- This project focuses on learning MJML structure rather than visual design
- The MJML file is intentionally kept simple and readable
- Compiled HTML is not included to keep the focus on MJML usage
